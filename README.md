   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python unified_server.py
   ```

2. **Open multiple browser tabs/windows**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Test multi-user functionality**:
   - Each tab represents a different user
   - First user becomes presenter automatically
   - Only presenter can start/stop screen sharing
   - Other users can request presenter rights
   - Everyone can use chat

## üß™ How to Test Multi-User Functionality

### Method 1: Multiple Browser Tabs
1. Open `http://localhost:8080` in multiple tabs
2. Each tab acts as a different user
3. Watch how users appear in the participants list

### Method 2: Different Browsers
1. Open the URL in Chrome: `http://localhost:8080`
2. Open the same URL in Firefox: `http://localhost:8080`
3. Open in Safari, Edge, etc.
4. Each browser represents a different user

### Method 3: Different Devices (Same Network)
1. Find your computer's IP address
2. On other devices, visit: `http://YOUR_IP:8080`
3. Each device joins as a separate user

### Method 4: Incognito/Private Windows
1. Open regular browser window
2. Open incognito/private window
3. Visit the same URL in both
4. Each window is treated as different user

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

```bash
python unified_server.py [options]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Server host address |
| `--port` | `8080` | Server port |
| `--fps` | `60` | Target frames per second |
| `--quality` | `85` | JPEG quality (1-100) |

### Examples

**High quality mode**:
```bash
python unified_server.py --fps 60 --quality 95
```

**Performance mode**:
```bash
python unified_server.py --fps 30 --quality 70
```

**Custom port**:
```bash
python unified_server.py --port 9000
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied" errors**:
- Run with administrator/root privileges
- Check screen recording permissions (macOS)

**High CPU usage**:
- Reduce FPS: `--fps 30`
- Lower quality: `--quality 70`
- Close unnecessary applications

**Connection issues**:
- Check firewall settings
- Try different port: `--port 9000`
- Test with `localhost` first

**Multiple users not working**:
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private windows
- Use different browsers
- Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by modifying the logging level in the script.

## üåê Network Setup

### Local Network
Works out of the box on your local network.

### Internet Access
For internet access:
1. Configure port forwarding on your router
2. Allow port through firewall
3. Share your public IP with users

## üîí Security Notes

- Designed for trusted networks
- No built-in authentication (add if needed)
- Consider HTTPS for production use
- Screen sharing requires appropriate permissions

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **Close unnecessary applications** to free CPU
2. **Use wired connection** for stability
3. **Adjust quality settings** based on network
4. **Monitor system resources** during use
5. **Test with fewer users** if performance issues occur
